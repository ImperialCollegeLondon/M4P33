M4 algebraic geometry course in Lean

## What is this?

In Jan to March 2020 I am teaching an algebraic geometry course at Imperial College London, which covers the basics of the theory of algebraic varieties (note: no schemes involved).

Hendrik Lenstra once told me that you only really learn something when you teach it. I have never really learnt this theory properly up until now, and I thought that one way I could try and understand the material better would be to formalise it all in the Lean Theorem Prover. Many thanks to Hendrik for his years of sound advice.

I am following the lectures of Martin Orr. Many thanks to Martin for making his notes available to me.
