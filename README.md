M4 algebraic geometry course in Lean

## What is this?

In Jan to March 2020 I am teaching an algebraic geometry course at Imperial College London, which covers the basics of the theory of algebraic varieties (note: no schemes involved). I am formalising some of the definitions and theorems in the Lean theorem prover.
