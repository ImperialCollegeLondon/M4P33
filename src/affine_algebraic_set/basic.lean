# Affine algebraic sets

This file defines affine algebraic subsets of affine n-space and proves basic properties
about them.

## Important definitions

* `affine_algebraic_set k n` -- the type of affine algebraic subsets of k‚Åø.

## Notation

None as yet -- do we need ùî∏‚Åø for affine n-space?

## Implementation notes

None yet.

variables {k : Type*} [comm_ring k]

-- and let n be a natural number
variable {n : ‚Ñï}

-- In Lean, the multivariable polynomial ring k[X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, ..., X‚Çô] is
-- denoted `mv_polynomial (fin n) k`. We could use better notation.
-- The set k‚Åø is denoted `fin n ‚Üí k` (which means maps from {0,1,2,...,(n-1)} to k).

-- We now make some definitions which we'll need in the course.
